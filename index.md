If you believe it is time for a **standard approach to web development**, this course may be for you. This is Dcycle's approach web development. In this course you will build working [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) sites from scratch using the four pillars of Dcycle's best practices: DevOps; standardized deployment, continuous integration; and automated testing. Don't worry if you haven't touched on these concepts before: this course is aimed at developers of all levels of expertise and takes nothing for granted.

Set aside **about 80 hours over eight to sixteen weeks** to assimilate the material and do the exercices. (Currently the entire course is scheduled to be completed by May 2016, [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dcycleproject) for updates). This course assumes you use Mac OS or Linux; if you use Windows, please make sure you can [install Vagrant](http://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-vagrant-windows/). Set aside a small budget---less than a hundred dollars---to launch servers in the cloud for testing and learning. The classes---all of them---are offered for free, covering the **strict minimum you need to know, with real-world examples and exercices**, organized in the following topics:

 * [*Class 1: Basics*](class-01-basics): How to get help on this course; using the command line; setting up a local development environment, ssh keys, and security basics. We'll use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for local development, testing, and deployment.
 * [*Class 2: Continuous integration*](class-02-continuous-integration): tools like [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) let you know the minute your code breaks. [Coming soon]
 * *Class 3: Test-driven development*: if it's not tested, it doesn't work. Learn [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) to write failing tests first, then fix them. [Coming soon]
 * *Class 4: Version control*: why and how to use [git](http://git-scm.com) (including branches and rebasing) for everything. [Coming soon]
 * *Class 5: Drupal*: We'll build a real, nontrivial [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) site and maintain it all along the course. [Coming soon]
 * *Class 6: Jeckyll*: You love Drupal, but a complex CMS it not for everything. Learn how to build a beautiful site in an hour with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and host it for free. [Coming soon]
 * *Class 7: Project management*: how to stay on time and on budget by applying [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org). [Coming soon]
 * *Class 8: Code vs. environment*: the difference between your deliverable and the way it's used. [Coming soon]
 * *Class 9: Code review*: introduce code review into your workflow using [Phabricator](http://phabricator.org), [GitHub](https://github.com), and [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/). [Coming soon]
 * *Class 10: Manage externalities*: externalities (third-party APIs, databases, server quirks) kill your productivity. Learn to kill them back. [Coming soon]
 * *Class 11: The community*: Leverage the open-source community; give back with documentation and share your code on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org) and [GitHub](https://github.com). [Coming soon]
 * *Class 12: Legacy code*: Learn how to recognize bad code, how not to write it, and how to bring it under control. [Coming soon]

In the future, a two-hour exam by teleconference is planned, and Dcycle certification will be offered to those who can demonstrate a solid understanding of the practical and theoretical aspects of the course.
